## graph

1. DFS is the common way to solve the graph problem
2. The time complexity of DFS would be O(Edges + Nodes)
3. Addtional space would be needed to track visisted nodes in some problem
4. UnionFind data structure is a special data structure which can be checked to sovle the problem when edges are given
5. UnionFind can be used only for undirected graph


## Algorithms

1. DFS
2. BFS
3. Topological sorting


## Data structure

1. stack
2. List
3. UnionFind
